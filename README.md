- **Edit a Contact**: Modify the phone number of an existing contact.
- **Delete a Contact**: Remove a contact from the list.

## Usage
1. **Compilation**: Compile the source code (`contact_management.cpp`) using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```
   g++ contact_management.cpp -o phonebook.exe
   ```
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable (`phonebook.exe`).
   ```
   ./phonebook.exe
   ```
3. **Menu Navigation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu options and perform desired operations.

## File Structure
- `contact_management.cpp`: Main C++ source code file containing the implementation.
